  "content": "\"Initial reports had the Venom F5 powered by a completely bespoke and proprietary 7.4 L twin-turbocharged V8 engine; later it was revealed that while being still in development, the engine is to have an even larger capacity of 8.0 liters but the final displacement of the engine was revealed to be 6.6 liters. The engine is confirmed to have a power output of 1,817 hp (1,355 kW; 1,842 PS) and 1,193 lb⋅ft (1,617 N⋅m) of torque. The Venom F5 will have an LS-based iron block engine. The top speed is claimed to be 301 mph (484 km/h) through a V-MAX speed-tracking system. Hennessey predicts the car will accelerate from 0–186 mph (0–300 km/h) in a time of under 10 seconds and from 0–249 mph (0–400 km/h) in a time of about 20 seconds.\nThe available transmissions will be a 7-speed single-clutch semi-automatic transmission with paddle shifters, driving the rear wheels, making the car rear-wheel drive along with a 6-speed manual transmission, both transmissions being offered as an option to customers.\nThe chassis and body will be made almost entirely of carbon fiber. Active aerodynamics are now paired with the body, a first for Hennessey. The weight reportedly stands at 2,950 lb (1,338 kg) with fluids, setting the power-to-weight ratio at 1,358 hp per ton. Because of the use of active aerodynamics and a sleek, new design it has an estimated drag coefficient of Cd=0.33.\nThe brakes are from Brembo, and the car is fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.\" by Wikipedia."
