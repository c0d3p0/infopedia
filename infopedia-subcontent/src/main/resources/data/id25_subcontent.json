  "content": "\"Only one R390 road car was ever produced by Nissan as a prototype for the development of the race-cars and was never intended for sale, although Nissan did offer to build further versions at a value of US$1 million. The lone R390 GT1 is currently stored at Nismo's Zama warehouse, along with the #32 R390 GT1 race car from 1998.\nThe vehicle is powered by the same 3.5 L (3,495 cc) twin-turbocharged VRH35L V8 engine as the race car, generating a power output of 558 PS (410 kW; 550 hp) at 6,800 rpm and 470 lb⋅ft (637 N⋅m) of torque at 4,400 rpm. All of this power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed sequential manual transmission. The car is able to accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 3.9 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in 11.9 seconds. The top speed is rated at 354 km/h (220 mph) by the manufacturer; however, none of the road tests featuring this car have been carried out for the purpose of top speed.\nInitially built with a red paint scheme and licensed \"P835 GUD\" in 1997, the car was rebuilt in 1998 with a new front end and side vents, longer tail and a ducktail spoiler instead of a wing, and repainted blue. This car was registered as \"R390 NIS\" and became known as the long tail version. These modifications were also incorporated on the race cars albeit with the addition of a fixed rear wing instead of a ducktail spoiler.\" by Wikipedia."
