  "content": "\"The Terzo Millennio uses high-capacity supercapacitors in lieu of batteries, due to their more rapid storage and discharge of energy. These supercapacitors have been made to simultaneously capture and release energy to give the car an increase in performance, without having to depend on chemical reactions. Each wheel, the rims of which glow orange, contains an electric motor, so that the amount of torque can be controlled individually, making the car's stability as good as a modern Formula One car. Because there is a motor on every wheel, the car's layout would be all-wheel drive if it was functional.\" by Wikipedia."
