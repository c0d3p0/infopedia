  "content": "\"The peanut's origins have been traced to Peru and was brought back to Europe by the Spanish, spreading to Africa and Asia. It arrives in North America in the 18th century with African slaves. Peanut pie was originally considered slave food, but by the 1940s peanuts were widely consumed and an advertisement for corn syrup (used to make the sweet, sticky pie filling) claimed that peanut pies could “make even your deepest-dyed Yankee start complimenting you with a southern accent.” The pie was popular in Virginia and North Carolina.\" by Wikipedia"
