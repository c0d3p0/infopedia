  "content": "\"Hypernovae are now widely accepted to be supernovae with ejecta having a kinetic energy larger than about 1052 erg, an order of magnitude higher than a typical core collapse supernova. The ejected nickel masses are large and the ejection velocity up to 99% of the speed of light. These are typically of type Ic, and some are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts. The electromagnetic energy released by these events varies from comparable to other type Ic supernova, to some of the most luminous supernovae known such as SN 1999as.\nThe archetypal hypernova SN 1998bw was associated with GRB 980425. Its spectrum showed no hydrogen and no clear helium features, but strong silicon lines identified it as a type Ic supernova. The main absorption lines were extremely broadened and the light curve showed a very rapid brightening phase, reaching the brightness of a type Ia supernova at day 16. The total ejected mass was about 10 masses of the sun and the mass of nickel ejected about 0.4 masses of the sun. All supernovae associated with GRBs have shown the high-energy ejecta that characterises them as hypernovae.\nUnusually bright radio supernovae have been observed as counterparts to hypernovae, and have been termed radio hypernovae.\" by Wikipedia."
