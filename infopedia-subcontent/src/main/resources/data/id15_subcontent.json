It was catalogued in 1895 by John Louis Emil Dreyer as the 1,101st object of the Index Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters (IC). At its discovery, it was identified as a nebulous feature. Following Edwin Hubble's 1932 discovery that some of the \"nebulous features\" were actually independent galaxies, subsequent analysis of objects in the sky were conducted and IC 1101 was therefore found to be one of the independent galaxies.\" by Wikipedia."
