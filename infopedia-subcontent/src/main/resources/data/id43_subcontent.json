During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \"geographically limited on the landscape\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp beak to bite off the leaves or needles and chop them up to be swallowed.\" by Wikipedia."
